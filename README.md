How do I approach designing software?

I have changed my approach as I have gone through this degree. At this point I tend to get an idea together, do a lot of research and look at examples, find pre made stuff and play with it to learn better how it works, and finally I code a skeleton that slowly forms into my end product through testing and feedback.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I have learned how to comprehend using math and different perspectives to create the world that I envision. This has helped me understand the abstact nature of visuals and how much of what we see is simulated using as little as possible rather than making everthing perfectly recreated.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I stated this above but with the added component of pictures of the scene I wanted to create and sourcing images then figuring out how those images can be translated to objects in the program.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The abstact thinking will be useful in many programming projects as it helps me look at things from many angles and create solutions that are more interesting and more efficient that just direct translation.

How do I approach developing programs?

I often try to find existing solutions to try working from and learning from and then tweaking them as needed for my own work or to make them more effective.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I modularized more functions and used structs more than in the past. I never thought of using structs for just small amounts of data and had always prefered in the past to make full classes but in this project I made both a mesh struct and a vertex struct that helped a lot when it came to creating objects.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Every time I worked on a new aspect or learned something new I would iterate through the whole project applying the new changes where it made sense. Through this I broke apart some meshes and got rid of hundreds of lines of redundant code making the troubleshoot easier and the program more efficient.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Each milestone added a new tool to my belt. First it was how to create my own meshes, then it was how texture coordinates really work, later it was how lighting and normals are calculated and how to simplify them, finally I found how to use loops, math and algorithms to build more complex meshes quickly and with fewer errors.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I aim to be a developer and a make games in my personal time. Understanding how computers work and how to develop software for them is perfectly in line with my end goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

It gives me a better foundation in software design and development which will help me better approach future projects and get into a masters eventually.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I want to get into game development more as a hobby and side job. Knowning how computer graphics are created from a basic level builds my ability to mold graphics engines I work with to my needs and helps me know how to operate them better.
